# ipyd3geo

A Jupyter widget for D3-based geospatial visualization.

It is designed to work similarly to other map renderer widgets, but uses D3-Geo as its renderer.

Using D3-Geo over other map renderers has a number of key benefits:
- Renders directly to an SVG. This package acts as a bridge between Jupyter-based geospatial tools, and cartography in design software.
- Maps can be arbitrarily styled with CSS or D3
- Native vector output means no pixelation, so rendered maps are infinitely scalable.
- Native best in class projection support. There are few if any conventionally defined projections that D3-Geo does not support (including certain very obscure ones)

However, there are a few tradeoffs:
- Due to its lack of virtualization, it is far less performant with large datasets than alternatives.
- It is intentionally client-side only, so it does not have any tiling server functionality
